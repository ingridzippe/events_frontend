 # events_app

Things That Are Working: 

  - regular login adds user to database
  - facebook login adds user to database
  - bottom bar navigates between screens
  - myprofile loads the events that this individual user posted
  - if the user is logged in it goes straight to posts
  - in testflight (aaye)
